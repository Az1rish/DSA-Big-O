1. 1) constant time O(1) - you ask once and get an answer
   2) linear time O(n) - you ask each person, so if the number of people increases, then number of "ticks" increases
   
2. constant time O(1) - regardless of the size of the value inputted, you check once is it's even and get an answer, true or false

3. polynomial time O(n^k), I believe quadratic O(n^2) because it includes a nested loop.

4. linear time O(n) because it is a loop that iterates over each item in the array once.

5. best case is constant time O(1), in which the first item checked is correct, worst case is linear time O(n) in which it checks each item and finds the correct one on the last item checked.

6. polynomial time O(n^k) - O(n^2) because it includes a nested loop.

7. linear time O(n) because it performs one action for each number, it creates an array with a fibonacci sequence starting at 0.

8. logarithmic time O(log(n)) because on each iteration it cuts the array in half, so it takes less time than linear time.

9. constant time O(1), it performs one action on the array, regardless of size of the array.

10. linear time O(n), it iterates through a loop and the time increases as the number increases, it checks if a number is prime.
